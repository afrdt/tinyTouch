An embroidered 8-bit synthesizer based on the ATtiny85. 
The synth has three capacitive sensors (made with conductive thread) and uses the Arduino CapSense library. 

Circuit:
1 x ATtiny85
1 x LilyPad Simple Power (+ connected to VCC pin and - to GND pin)
1 x 3.7V LiPo battery
3 x Capacitive sensors (connected to digital pins 1, 3, 4)
3 x 4.7 MÎ© resistors (between digital pin 2 and the sensors' pins)
1 x mini-jack/speaker (audio output connected to digital pin 0)
